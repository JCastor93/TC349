<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My sort differed in a few ways from the NASA Moon Website. Neil Armstrong is someone who is extremely important to the history of the moon, so I felt it appropriate to put the content in the about the moon section. Also, the directory of the missions was no where near the missions section, so I moved that to that section. Twitter is a part of the multimedia experience, and was not part of the original website structure, so I included that. The getting involved and strategic partners sections didn’t seem to have anything under them, so I took things I felt appropriate to those sections and placed them in those categories to make finding them easier and to give the website a better structure.</p>
<p>Many of the differences between my sort and my partners sorts was in the News and Events category and in the categories they added that I didn’t. For example, one of my partners put products in the news and events category and added an about NASA category. She also put get involved into the news and events category as well. Other than that, two of my partners sorts were quite similar to mine. My third partner, on the other hand, took a different approach and renamed the categories from the website. For example, she had history of the moon as a category instead of about the moon. Having three other people sort the data really helped me organize my data more efficiently and think about the content in ways I hadn’t thought about it before.</p>
