<h1>Idea for Personal Website</h1>
<p>I want to design a personal website to list my education, accomplishments, contact info (email, Facebook, Twitter), and my experience. I believe this will be a good way to show people what I’ve done, as well as give them a website to look at when I don’t have my resume handy. This will also give me a more official web presence other than my Facebook and Twitter profiles.</p>
