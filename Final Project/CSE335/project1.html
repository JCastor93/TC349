		<h1>Project 1 - The Aquarium Game</h1>
		<h2>Team Bruce</h2>
		<h3>Team Members and Individual Responsibilities</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Ben Taylor: Environment</li>
			<li>Jordyn Castor: Reporting</li>
			<li>Whitney Mitchell: Treasure Chest</li>
		</ul>
<h2>Part 1</h2>
		<h3>Project Instructions</h3>
		<h4>Adding Fish</h4>
			<p>To add a fish: 
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the "Add Fish" menu</li>
				<li>Choose a fish from the menu.</li>
			</ol>
		<h4>Removing Fish</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the "File" menu</li>
				<li>Select "Trash Can"</li>
				<li>Drag the fish you wish to remove over the trashcan with the mouse</li>
			</ol>
		<h4>Adding Decor</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the "Add Decor" menu</li>
				<li>Choose a decor item from the menu.</li>
			</ol>
		<h4>Saving The Aquarium Items</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the "File" menu</li>
				<li>Select "Save As"</li>
				<li>Enter the desired file name and click "OK" to save the aquarium</li>
			</ol>
		<h4>Loading a Saved Aquarium</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the "File" menu</li>
				<li>Select "Open"</li>
				<li>Locate the desired aquarium file and click "OK" to open the saved
aquarium</li>
			</ol>
		<h4>Counting Beta Fish</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the "File" menu</li>
				<li>Select "Count Beta Fish"</li>
				<li>Click "OK" to close the dialog box</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Interface Decisions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Placed scroll icon in lower left-hand corner, the more likely direction to scroll
initially</li>
			<li> Fix image in the top left corner if the window is larger than the
background image, to keep content near the menus</li>
			<li> Store times in XML in milliseconds, but display in more visually meaningful
whole seconds.</li>
		</ul> 
		<h3>Part  2Ideas</h3>
			<p>We intend to implement a game mechanic based upon the cleanliness of the tank,
where factors in the environment will contribute to the rate at which the tank becomes dirty. The
user's goal will be to maintain balance in the tank, as the rate at which random harmful effects
accrue increases, making the game more difficult over time.</p>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<h3>Game Instructions</h3>
<p>When the program starts, the game will begin. The game has five levels, each
lasting roughly a minute. The algae will appear more frequently 
and fewer fish will automatically be generated with each level you
pass. The object of the game is to feed the fish before they starve, as well as
to remove any algae that appears in the fish tank. When there are more than
fifteen algae in the tank, or the fish are not fed in time, the game ends. To
feed the fish, press the letter f. To clean the tank, press c. To remove the
algae, drag it over the trash can.</p>
<h4> Scoring</h4>
<p>Scoring is based on the amount of fish and algae left in the tank.</p>
<p>Each fish you save is worth a different amount of points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Molly: 5</li>
<li>Nemo: 3</li>
<li>Beta: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Each algae left in the tank will deduct two from the score.</p>
